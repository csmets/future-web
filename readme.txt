FUTURE WEB FRAMEWORK
===============================================================================

Showcasing my belief on what the potential future holds in front end web
development. While it's mostly opionionated, I believe we will eventually set
away from the polyfills and write mostly vanilla again. At work I use a lot of
modules to create my build using gulp and other like build tools. Since JS ES6
and new features in CSS3 I believe npm modules will not become redundant but
will fade into development only uses; like linting and testing. Production code
will be done in purity.

To do list
------------------------------------------------
    - [WIP] HTML5 Markup
    - [WIP] JS (ES6)
    - [x]   JS Unit tests
    - [x]   ESlint
    - [WIP] CSS3
    - [x]   CSS3 Unit tests
    - [x]   Stylelint
    - [WIP] VueJS for SPA and Custom Components
    - [x]   Behaviour tests
    - [x]   Service workers
    - [x]   Continuous Integration


Pet hates
-----------------------------------------------
    - Bootstrap JS requires JQuery
      JQuery is been said that it's "here to stay" but I believe it's time is
      soon to end. To see that bootstrap 4 relies on JQuery is a huge
      disapointment. They claim to have rewritten it from scratch, why not dump
      the extra dependency.

      The reason as to why I still include bootstrap is that there is no doubt
      that bootstrap will continue to be the dominate framework, thus it should
      be added into the future web.
