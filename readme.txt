FUTURE WEB DEVELOPMENT
===============================================================================

Showcasing my belief on what the potential future holds in front-end web
development. While it's mostly opionionated, I believe we will eventually set
away from the polyfills and write mostly vanilla again. At work I use a lot of
modules to create my builds using gulp and other like build tools. Since JS ES6
and new features in CSS3 I believe npm modules will not become redundant but
will fade into development only uses; like linting and testing. Production code
will be done in purity.

Notes
-----------------------------------------------

WebGL
-----
It seems that WebGL might become a favourite for interactive websites just like
back in the day with Flash. Whilst I see it's potential I don't feel that it
will be a dominate force due to performance and load. That doesn't mean that I
won't include it in this project, but a WebGL app has it's own framework and
rules which strays away from standard web development.

Bootstrap and jQuery
--------------------
Earlier I had used bootstrap 4 with the required jQuery library, I've found it
that whilst it provided rapidness in setting up the skeleton of the website it
did come at a cost; size. I felt that it was unnessary to load such a blocking
library that it's best to remove it all together.
